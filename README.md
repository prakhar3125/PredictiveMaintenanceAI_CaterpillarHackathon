-Developed a full-stack application to manage vehicle reports, dynamically convert telematics data into JSON, and
integrate with a Python-based machine learning model for risk prediction. Implemented a secure user
authentication system to enhance user management. This enabled data-driven preventive maintenance and
enhanced operational efficiency.

-Engineered a Node.js and MySQL backend for user registration and login with secure password hashing.
Implemented a machine learning model for automated risk assessment, optimizing user experience and prediction
reliability.

-Developed an endpoint to convert vehicle datasets into JSON and integrate with a Python ML model, improving
real-time risk prediction accuracy and reducing processing time.
